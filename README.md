# Password Generator
## Description
Password generator programs I've created in both Java and Python. These programs will generate a password by randomly selecting characters. First a type 
of character will be selected (from: upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters), then a character from that list will be randomly
selected. These selections will be made using the Python module/Java class random.
